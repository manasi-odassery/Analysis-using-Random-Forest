Repository Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files and documentation for two machine learning projects using Random Forest classifiers. The projects focus on Sales Classification and Fraud Detection, showcasing how Random Forest can be applied to solve real-world business challenges effectively.

Projects Included:
Sales Classification: Analyzes sales data to identify key factors influencing sales performance across various store locations.
Fraud Detection: Aims to classify individuals as 'Risky' or 'Good' based on their financial data to predict potential fraudulent activities.

Project Insights
Sales Classification: Identified that competitor price and local income levels are significant predictors of sales performance. The model helps in targeting specific geographic and demographic markets for business growth.
Fraud Detection: The model effectively highlights the importance of demographic factors in predicting financial risk, though further improvement is needed for better accuracy in the 'Risky' category.
